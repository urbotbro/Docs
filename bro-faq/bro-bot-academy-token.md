<summary>What are the tokenomics of Bro Bot Academy Token?</summary>

The project launched with a Fair Launch, where 100% of the token supply, totaling 1 million tokens, was added to liquidity right from the start. The tokens are fully circulating and non-dilutive. ( Edit ) \*\*

The buy and sell tax is split 2/4, meaning 2% goes to the liquidity pool upon buying, and upon selling, 4% tax is applied. Out of this 4% sell tax, 2% goes to revenue sharing for holders, and the remaining 2% is allocated to the team.

Additionally, 45% of all bot transaction fees are distributed to holders as revenue sharing.

There's no staking or lockup requirement; holders simply need to maintain ownership of 10 or more tokens to be eligible for revenue sharing.

Revenue share is distributed in ETH by default.
