<summary><strong>Is Bro Token Secure?</strong></summary>

* Private keys are secured using industry-standard encryption, ensuring that no one, including ourselves, has access to them. They are not stored on our servers, databases, or website.
* In contrast to centralized exchanges (CEX), users retain full control over their private keys for Bro Bot-generated trading wallets. This enables users to import their keys into MetaMask, providing them with complete control over their funds within Bro Bot at all times.
* It's crucial to treat your wallet as a hot wallet, maintaining vigilance over its security.
* We're committed to continually enhancing features to provide users with greater peace of mind regarding wallet security. For instance, we plan to implement features such as automatic ETH transfers when your balance exceeds a custom threshold amount.
