# ðŸ“¤ Limit Sell Orders

### FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why didn't my limit order trigger?</summary>

A limit order may not have triggered for various reasons:

* The order considers the price impact of your potential swap. Even if the market price moved near the trigger, your order might move the price out of the trigger range.
* Swaps for that token may have been executed before yours in the block, influencing the token price and causing your order to fail.

<summary>What is the maximum expiry time for a limit order?</summary>

There is no limit on the expiry time you can use.

<summary>Why isn't my token in the list of available tokens to sell?</summary>

Each token balance must be worth at least 0.01 ETH to appear in the list of sellable tokens. On the ETH network, selling tokens worth less than 0.01 ETH will rarely be worth the gas costs.

* **Expiration (Hours)** - The amount of hours before the order expires and is automatically cancelled.
* **% Amount to Sell** - Specify the % of tokens to sell.
* **Trigger Price (% Change)** - The % price decrease (stop-loss) or increase (take-profit) that should occur for the limit order to trigger.
