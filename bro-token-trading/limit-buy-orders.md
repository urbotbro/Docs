# ðŸ“¥ Limit Buy Orders

### FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why didn't my limit order trigger?</summary>

A limit order might not have triggered due to various reasons:

* The limit order factors in the price impact of your potential swap. Even if the market price moved near the trigger, your order could move the price out of the trigger range.
* Swaps for that token may have been executed before yours in the block, influencing the token price and resulting in your order failing.

<summary>What is the maximum expiry time for a limit order?</summary>

There is no limit on the expiry time you can use.

<summary>How is the token's USD price computed?</summary>

Every block, limit orders undergo trigger checks by computing the USD price of the token:

* The reserves of the token trading pair and your token input amount are utilized to determine the equivalent ETH amount for your tokens.
* The USD price of ETH is calculated based on the USDC-WETH Uniswap pool.
* These two results are then used to compute the equivalent USD price of your tokens.
