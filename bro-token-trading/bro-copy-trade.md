### FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why didn't my Copy Trade trigger?</summary>

Copy Trade currently only supports copying Uniswap router functions (V2, V3, multicall, execute, etc.). Swaps made through custom functions or other routers such as 1inch are not supported for copy trading. We will enhance Copy Trade functionality over time.

<details>

<summary>Does Copy Trade also copy sells?</summary>

Currently, Copy Trade only copies buy transactions. Support for copying sell transactions will be added at a later time.
