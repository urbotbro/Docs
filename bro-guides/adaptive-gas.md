### FAQ

<details>

<summary>What do the gas strategies mean?</summary>

Bro Token's gas analyzer monitors the network to understand the distribution of gas prices and determine optimal gas price parameters. Users can select from three strategies:

1. Eco Mode: Maximizes gas savings, but may occasionally result in your transaction taking an additional block to be confirmed.
2. Smart Mode: Strikes a balance between Eco and Aggressive mode. Outperforms most competitors' gas prices without overpaying, ensuring your transaction is confirmed swiftly.
3. Aggressive Mode: Utilizes higher gas to frontrun and surpass the competition.
