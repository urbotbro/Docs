<summary>Why do I need to send at least 0.02 ETH to my trading wallet(s)?</summary>

Wallets with balances below 0.01 ETH are deemed inactive for trading, and our system disregards them. Such balances are inadequate to cover Ethereum gas costs.

Maintaining a balance of at least 0.02 ETH ensures that you won't encounter any gas-related issues.
